# If “Good Enough” Doesn’t Cut It for You, You’re in the Right Place.
**🚀 Full-Stack Engineer | UX/UI Designer | Problem Solver**<br/>

Hot takes aside, I'm Caleb Theil, a passionate full-stack engineer with 4 years of experience and a degree in digital design. 
<br/>
I'm a self-taught problem solver who began this journey by **spotting inefficiencies** and **refusing to accept the status quo.** My unique blend of technical expertise and design sensibility allows me to elevate user interfaces and optimize backend systems, making complex challenges feel like second nature.
